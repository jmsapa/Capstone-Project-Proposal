What is the problem you want to solve?
The problem that i want to solve is what would the box office totals be for each major film genre if Martin Scorsese and Michael Fassbender made a film together.

Who is your client and why do they care about this problem? In other words, what will your client DO or DECIDE based on your analysis that they wouldnâ€™t have otherwise?
My client would be any film studio and film financier who are looking to make a film with Martin Scorsese and Michael Fassbender and trying to decide what type of film they would want to produce/finance that would have the highest return. They would use my data to make an accurate decision on what type of film would the most money and would be the cheapest to produce.

What data are you going to use for this? How will you acquire this data?
I am going to use domestic box office results from the year 2000 until the year 2015. I will acquire this data using reputable hollywood websites and industry trade magazines/websites.

In brief, outline your approach to solving this problem.
First, I plan on finding the box office totals for both Martin Scorsese and Michael Fassbenders entire career. I will then categorize them into different genre groups and then apply inflation to their films to see what they would have made today. Once this is completed I will start finding data for the top 100 films for each year from 2000-2015. I will also apply inflation rates to these films as well. Once this is complete i will then start comparing data from my two subjects and compare their returns to the top 100 films for the last 15 years, and work towards finding out the different box office totals that they can expect to generate for each major film genre.
